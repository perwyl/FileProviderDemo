This library provides implementaion of WebDav and SMB/CIFS (incomplete) and local files.

All functions are async calls and it wont block your main thread.

Local and WebDAV providers are fully tested and can be used in production environment.

## Features

- [x] **LocalFileProvider** a wrapper around `NSFileManager` with some additions like searching and reading a portion of file.
- [x] **WebDAVFileProvider** WebDAV protocol is usual file transmission system on Macs.
- [ ] **SMBFileProvider** SMB/CIFS and SMB2/3 are file and printer sharing protocol which is originated from IBM & Microsoft and SMB2/3 is now replacing AFP protocol on MacOS. I implemented data types and some basic functions but *main interface is not implemented yet!*
- [ ] **DropboxFileProvider** *partially implemented*
- [ ] **FTPFileProvider**
- [ ] **AmazonS3FileProvider**

## Requirements

- **Swift 2.2**
- iOS 8.0 , OSX 10.10
- XCode 7.3

## Installation

### Cocoapods / Carthage / Swift Package Manager

FileProvider supports both CocoaPods. 

Add this line to your pods file:

	pod "FileProvider"

### Git
To have latest updates with ease, use this command on terminal to get a clone:

	git clone https://github.com/amosavian/FileProvider FileProvider
	
You can update your library using this command in FileProvider folder:

	git pull

if you have a git based project, use this command in your projects directory to add this project as a submodule to your project:

	git submodule add https://github.com/amosavian/FileProvider FileProvider

### Manually
Copy Source folder to your project and Voila!

## Usage

Each provider has a specific class which conforms to FileProvider protocol and share same syntax

### Initialization

For LocalFileProvider if you want to deal with `Documents` folder

	let documentsProvider = LocalFileProvider()

is equal to:
	    
	let documentPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSSearchPathDirectory.DocumentDirectory, NSSearchPathDomainMask.UserDomainMask, true);
	let documentsURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: documentPath);
	let documentsProvider = LocalFileProvider(baseURL: documentsURL)

You can't change the base url later. and all paths are related to this base url by default.

For remote file providers authentication may be necessary:

	let credential = NSURLCredential(user: "user", password: "pass", persistence: NSURLCredentialPersistence.Permanent)
	let webdavProvider = WebDAVFileProvider(baseURL: "http://www.example.com/dav", credential: credential)

* For Dropbox, user is clientID and password is Token which both must be retrieved via [OAuth2 API of Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/oauth-guide). There are libraries like [p2/OAuth2](https://github.com/p2/OAuth2) or [OAuthSwift](https://github.com/OAuthSwift/OAuthSwift) which can facilate the procedure to retrieve token.
	
For interaction with UI, set delegate variable of `FileProvider` object

You can use `absoluteURL()` method if provider to get direct access url (local or remote files) for some file systems which allows to do so (Dropbox doesn't support and returns path simply)

### Delegates

For updating User interface please consider using delegate method instead of completion handlers. Delegate methods are guaranteed to run in main thread to avoid bugs.

It's simply tree method which indicated whether the operation failed, succeed and how much of operation has been done (suitable for uploading and downloading operations).

Your class should conforms `FileProviderDelegate` class:

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		documentsProvider.delegate = self
	}
	
	func fileproviderSucceed(fileProvider: FileProvider, operation: FileOperation) {
		switch operation {
		case .Copy(source: let source, destination: let dest):
			NSLog("\(source) copied to \(dest).")
		case .Remove(path: let path):
			NSLog("\(path) has been deleted.")
		default:
			break
		}
	}
	
    func fileproviderFailed(fileProvider: FileProvider, operation: FileOperation) {
    	switch operation {
		case .Copy(source: let source, destination: let dest):
			NSLog("copy of \(source) failed.")
		case .Remove(path: let path):
			NSLog("\(path) can't be deleted.")
		default:
			break
		}
    }
	
    func fileproviderProgress(fileProvider: FileProvider, operation: FileOperation, progress: Float) {
		switch operation {
		case .Copy(source: let source, destination: let dest):
			NSLog("Copy\(source) to \(dest): \(progress * 100) completed.")
		default:
			break
		}
	}

**Note:** `fileproviderProgress()` delegate method is not called by `LocalFileProvider`. 

It's recommended to use completion handlers for error handling or result processing.

#### Controlling file operations

You can also implement `FileOperationDelegate` protocol to control behaviour of file operation (copy, move/rename, remove and linking), and decide which files should be removed for example and which won't. 

`fileProvider:shouldDoOperation:` method is called before doing a operation. You sould return `true` if you want to do operation or `false` if you want to stop that operation.

`fileProvider:shouldProceedAfterError:operation:` will be called if an error occured during file operations. Return `true` if you want to continue operation on next files or `false` if you want stop operation further. Default value is false if you don't implement delegate.

**Note: these methods will be called for files in a directory and its subfolders recursively.**

### Directory contents and file attributes

There is a `FileObject` class which holds file attributes like size and creation date. You can retrieve information of files inside a directory or get information of a file directly.

For a single file:

	documentsProvider.attributesOfItemAtPath(path: "/file.txt", completionHandler: {
	    (attributes: LocalFileObject?, error: ErrorType?) -> Void} in
		if let attributes = attributes {
			print("File Size: \(attributes.size)")
			print("Creation Date: \(attributes.createdDate)")
			print("Modification Date: \(modifiedDate)")
			print("Is Read Only: \(isReadOnly)")
		}
	)

To get list of files in a directory:

	documentsProvider.contentsOfDirectoryAtPath(path: "/", 	completionHandler: {
	    (contents: [LocalFileObject], error: ErrorType?) -> Void} in
		for file in contents {
			print("Name: \(attributes.name)")
			print("Size: \(attributes.size)")
			print("Creation Date: \(attributes.createdDate)")
			print("Modification Date: \(modifiedDate)")
		}
	)

### Change current directory

	documentsProvider.currentPath = "/New Folder"
	// now path is ~/Documents/New Folder
	
You can then pass "" (empty string) to contentsOfDirectoryAtPath method to list files in current directory.

### Creating File and Folders

Creating new directory:

	documentsProvider.createFolder(folderName: "new folder", atPath: "/", completionHandler: nil)

Creating new file from data stream:

	let data = "hello world!".dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
	let file = FileObject(name: "old.txt", createdDate: NSDate(), modifiedDate: NSDate(), isHidden: false, isReadOnly: true)
	documentsProvider.createFile(fileAttribs: file, atPath: "/", contents: data, completionHandler: nil)

### Copy and Move/Rename Files

Copy file old.txt to new.txt in current path:

	documentsProvider.copyItemAtPath(path: "new folder/old.txt", toPath: "new.txt", overwrite: false, completionHandler: nil)

Move file old.txt to new.txt in current path:

	documentsProvider.moveItemAtPath(path: "new folder/old.txt", toPath: "new.txt", overwrite: false, completionHandler: nil)

### Delete Files

	documentsProvider.removeItemAtPath(path: "new.txt", completionHandler: nil)

***Caution:*** This method will delete directories with all it's content recursively.

### Retrieve Content of File

THere is two method for this purpose, one of them loads entire file into NSData and another can load a portion of file.

	documentsProvider.contentsAtPath(path: "old.txt", completionHandler: {
		(contents: NSData?, error: ErrorType?) -> Void
		if let contents = contents {
			print(String(data: contents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)) // "hello world!"
		}
	})
	
If you want to retrieve a portion of file you should can `contentsAtPath` method with offset and length arguments. Please note first byte of file has offset: 0.

	documentsProvider.contentsAtPath(path: "old.txt", offset: 2, length: 5, completionHandler: {
		(contents: NSData?, error: ErrorType?) -> Void
		if let contents = contents {
			print(String(data: contents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)) // "llo w"
		}
	})

### Write Data To Files

	let data = "What's up Newyork!".dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
	documentsProvider.writeContentsAtPath(path: "old.txt", contents data: data, atomically: true, completionHandler: nil)

### Monitoring FIle Changes

You can monitor updates in some file system (Local and SMB2), there is three methods in supporting provider you can use to register a handler, to unregister and to check whether it's being monitored or not. It's useful to find out when new files added or removed from directory and update user interface. The handler will be dispatched to main threads to avoid UI bugs with a 0.25 sec delay.

	documentsProvider.registerNotifcation(provider.currentPath)
	{
		// calling functions to update UI 
	}
	
	// To discontinue monitoring folders:
	documentsProvider.unregisterNotifcation(provider.currentPath)

* **Please note** in LocalFileProvider it will also monitor changes in subfolders. This behaviour can varies according to file system specification.
